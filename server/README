This node server uses ES6 syntax, so babel-cli is required for it to
compile and change the files to known javascript syntax.

First of all you need to run "npm install" for all the packages to install.

After that, to get this to work, use "npm run build-dev" (a script made to make babel compile
and watch for changes) or "npm run build" (only compiles once).

After that, you can run "node dist/index.js".
